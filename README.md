(gouegd: changed some things on the scoped reducers branch to experiment with a loading indicator when using RxJS)

# connect-rxjs-to-react

Simple way to connect [rxjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs) to React component in Redux style... but without dispatch and constants.

```js
export default connect(state$, state => ({
  counter: state.counter,
  increment: CounterActions.increment$.next,
  decrement: CounterActions.decrement$.next,
}))(Counter);
```
